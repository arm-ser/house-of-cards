# House of Cards

I would like to take a moment and thank people that played very important role in my learning process (SEE Teachers Section). Their informative and engaging videos, articles and classes have simplified complex topics, making them accessible and enjoyable for me to grasp. Their dedication to sharing knowledge has had a profound impact on my growth, and I am truly thankful for their valuable contributions. I encourage you to subscribe and contribut to their work. Best regards to all of you. 

## Home Lab

This repository contains the configuration files and documentation for my home lab, which is a network environment consisting of multiple servers and Docker containers. The purpose of this lab is to provide a platform for learning, experimentation, and testing of various networking and security technologies.

### Future Learning and Roadmap

Here are my future learning plans and a simple roadmap to guide my progress and skill development in different technologies and practices.

1.  **Deploy Proxmox**: To optimize resource usage and scalability by managing virtual machines and containers in each of the servers.
4.  **Deploy Honeypots**: Deploying honeypots will provide valuable insights into threats and enhances lab security.
2.  **Learn Terraform**: To automate infrastructure configuration, ensuring consistent and reproducible resource provisioning in my lab.
3.  **Learn Ansible**: To simplify system and application management in my lab by automating tasks and maintaining consistent configurations.
5.  **Learn Kubernetes**: To facilitate easy scaling and orchestration of containerized applications in the lab.
